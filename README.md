# Otter based Math Game

 using a Basys3 board we implemented a game that uses a random number generator to produce two numbers to be either added, subtracted, or multiplied. The operation is also randomly determined. Three numbers are displayed beneath the question. For visuals we implemented the VGA Driver with the OTTER Wrapper.
